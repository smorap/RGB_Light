This is an app I made as a xmas gift for my girlfriend. It's a RGB light that can be controlled with a smartphone app using XYremote.

### Description
It is a strip light that can be connected via Bluetooth using an ESP32 as MC (yeah, it's overkill but cheap too) with a smartphone app. The app is made with XYremote and I used the Arduine IDE for programming the ESP32.
I use a RGB strip not adressable, an ESP32 dev kit, a couple of regulators, transistors and a relay module for this project. 
I put the relay because there was some noise that make the lights flashing when it was supposed to be turn off.
