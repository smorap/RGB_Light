# RGB_Light
This is an app I made as a xmas gift for my girlfriend. It's a RGB light that can be controlled with a smartphone app using XYremote.

### Description
It is a strip light that can be connected via Bluetooth using an ESP32 as mic (yeah, it's overkill but cheap too) with a smartphone app. The is made with XYremote.
I use a RGB strip not adressable, an ESP32 dev kit and a relay module for this project.
